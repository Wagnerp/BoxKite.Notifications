I'm also cleaning up the code for readability as I go.\r\n\r\nTo install it from NuGet:\r\n\r\n###`PM> Install-Package BoxKite.Notifications -Version 0.0.4-pre -Pre`\r\n\r\n## How do I use it?\r\n\r\nFirst off, have a look at the notification [templates available](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh761491.aspx) for creating notifications. This will give you an idea of what information you can show to users. \r\n\r\nAfter installing the NuGet package, add these namespaces to the top of the class:\r\n\r\n    using BoxKite.Notifications;\r\n    using BoxKite.Notifications.Templates;\r\n\r\n### Tile Notifications\r\n\r\nThen, use the `TileContentFactory` static class to create the desired template and populate the content.\r\n\r\n    var tileUpdate = TileContentFactory.CreateTileWideSmallImageAndText03();\r\n    tileUpdate.Image.Src = tweet.User.Avatar;\r\n    tileUpdate.TextBodyWrap.Text = tweet.Text;\r\n    tileUpdate.Image.Alt = tweet.User.Name;\r\n\r\n    var squareUpdate = TileContentFactory.CreateTileSquareText04();\r\n    squareUpdate.TextBodyWrap.Text = tweet.Text;\r\n    tileUpdate.SquareContent = squareContent;\r\n\r\n**Note:** why did I create two tiles? Because the live tiles may be wide or square depending on how the user has configured the tile - don't forget this!\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, send this update to the TileUpdateManager:\r\n\r\n    TileUpdateManager.CreateTileUpdaterForApplication().Update(tileUpdate.CreateNotification()); \r\n  \r\nAnd that's it. How easy is that?\r\n\r\n### Toast Notifications\r\n\r\nThese behave in a similar way, using `ToastContentFactory` instead.\r\n\r\n    var notifier = ToastNotificationManager.CreateToastNotifier();\r\n    if (notifier.Setting == NotificationSetting.Enabled)\r\n    {\r\n        var template = ToastContentFactory.CreateToastImageAndText04();\r\n\r\n        template.TextHeading.Text = \"Some Heading\";\r\n        template.TextBody1.Text = \"Words go here\";\r\n        template.TextBody2.Text = \"and also here\";\r\n        template.Image.Src = \"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5803705/sample.png\";\r\n\r\n        ToastNotificationManager.CreateToastNotifier().Show(template.CreateNotification());    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n## What else is missing?\r\n\r\nI haven't integrated the BadgeContent samples (to show numbers or symbols on the tile). Let's see if I can do this now\r\n\r\nI'd rather keep this library specialized for a single task, but if there's features you think would work nicely within this context you can get in touch on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/shiftkey) or leave an issue on [the site](https://github.com/shiftkey/BoxKite.Notifications/issues)...\r\n\r\nAlso open to pull requests to simplify the API - while the syntax makes it easy to discover, I'm not a huge fan of the `template.Foo.Bar.Something` dot-heavy conventions...\r\n\r\n## Why MS-LPL (Microsoft Limited Public License)?\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would have chosen a more permissive license. However this was the licence associated with all the Windows 8 samples. I am not a lawyer, so I am choosing to follow the upstream licenses with this project.","name":"Boxkite.Notifications","tagline":"Create notifications for your Windows 8 apps without parsing XML like a caveman"}
